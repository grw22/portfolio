          <p>
            This app concept stems from my own experience transitioning careers and recognising the challenges of building meaningful professional networks. During a Product Management course, I collaborated on a project aimed at creating an app to connect career changers and mentors. That experience sparked the idea for this appâ€”a platform where individuals could find guidance, mentorship, and opportunities to share knowledge, making career changes smoother and more accessible.

          <ol className="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-2">
            <li>Facilitate mentorship for career changers by providing personalised connections.</li>
            <li>Empower mentors to refine their skills in knowledge sharing and self-improvement.</li>
            <li>Showcase my product management, UX design, and technical skills in a practical portfolio project.</li>

              <h4 className="font-medium mb-1">1. Initial Planning</h4>
              <p>
                The idea evolved during my product management course, where I learned to create user-focused solutions, manage ambiguity, and collaborate effectively. I started by defining the app's primary goal: to connect career changers with mentors in a way that is intuitive, private, and impactful.

              <h4 className="font-medium mb-1">2. User Flow Design</h4>
              <p>
                Using <span className="font-medium">Miro</span>, I mapped out the entire user flow to visualise the onboarding process, matching mechanism, messaging functionality, and account management. This provided a clear blueprint for the app's structure and functionality.

              <h4 className="font-medium mb-1">3. Wireframing</h4>
              <p>
                I created medium-fidelity wireframes in <span className="font-medium">Balsamiq</span> to bring the app's structure to life. The wireframes focus on key screens such as login, profile creation, matching, and messaging. These designs are iterative and will be refined based on feedback and testing.
